# Iris Classification
Using the [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) to predict whether a flower is an Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica based on its sepal and petal lengths and widths. In this program, synaptic.js is used to set up the neural network. This is my submission for MVCS Club's competition for February 2016.

## Testing
Clone the repo onto your computer and move into the directory.

Move into the Iris-Classification directory.

Install necessary Node modules using npm.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/avikj/Iris-Classification.git
cd Iris-Classification
npm install
```
Edit testing_data.txt and replace the existing data with your own tests. Each line should follow this format:
```
<sepal length>,<sepal width>,<petal length>,<petal width>
```
Run main.js
```shell
node main.js
```
The results should be printed to the console after a few seconds. Compare these with the actual classifications to verify the accuracy of the program.
